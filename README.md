# Dgtl-Circuit-Dsgn-Verilog-Labs

This Repository consists of most of the labs my partner and I have done in my Digital Circuit Design Verilog course. We have used the Nexys A7-100T FPGA board and the Vivado application to learn how to use the Verilog HDL language to complete our projects.

Note: "Unpaid Interns" is just a group name my partner and I came up with. We have worked on these projects together but the midterms were done individually so the midterms folders contains the work I have done only.
