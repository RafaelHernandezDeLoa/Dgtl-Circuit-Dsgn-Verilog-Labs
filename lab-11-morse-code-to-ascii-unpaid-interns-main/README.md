<ins> Morse Code to ASCII</ins>

In this lab, we were tasked to created a circuit which will display the ASCII code of each letter we are trying to input into our morse decoder. We used the same morse decoder code from lab 10 with the exception that we fixed up our lg and wg output behaviors. For example, we have our lg state here go to the pressed state instead of going back into the ideal stage. We also have changed the range for the timing of each stage so that our morse decoder can better reflect the desired output we are looking for when we input our sequence of b values into the fsm. We kept the shift register and udl counter that will keep track of the information needed to distinguish the kind of letter we are trying to input into our circuit. We included an OR gate to help clear these devices to reflect the next letter we would like to input into the decoder. We used these devices to help output the right address into a synchronous ROM module through a multiplexer to help get the right ASCII number to be displayed on the board. The ROM module will help output the right ASCII number through a FIFO module which will help display all the ASCII numbers I would like to output onto our board displays. Within the module, we had to include a D flip flop and the multiplexer before the synchronous ROM so that when the morse decoder outputs a high signal at the output wg, the circuit will be able to output the ASCII code for a space onto the display to indicate that the word has been completed and that we will be reading the next word on our display. Before the ASCII code gets displayed, it goes throught a FIFO which regulates what ASCII code gets displays and piles all the codes we created in the FIFO. This allows us to look at all the ASCII codes we created one at a time when we ask the circuit to display the next code that it has received. Overall, this whole circuit would display the pattern we are inputing into the machine, display the codes for the patterns we inputted and also shows us throught an led when the circuit has no more ASCII codes to show us.
